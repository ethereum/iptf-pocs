# [PoC Name]

> **Status:** Draft | In Progress | Complete
> **Privacy Primitive:** [e.g., confidential transfers, private voting, anonymous credentials]

## Overview

Brief description of what this PoC demonstrates.

## Cryptographic Assumptions

- **Primitives used:** [e.g., Pedersen commitments, zk-SNARKs, ring signatures]
- **Security assumptions:** [e.g., discrete log hardness in the chosen group]
- **Trusted setup:** [Yes/No, and details if yes]

## Threat Model

What does this protect against:
- [ ] Public observers cannot learn X
- [ ] Validators cannot learn Y

What this does NOT protect against:
- Collusion between A and B
- Side-channel attacks
- etc.
