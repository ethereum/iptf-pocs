# [Protocol Name]: Protocol Specification

## Problem Statement

What problem are we solving? Why does it matter?

### Constraints

What requirements must be met:

- Privacy: [what must stay private, from whom]
- Regulatory: [compliance requirements]
- Operational: [integration, performance, usability needs]
- Trust: [who can/cannot be trusted]

## Approach

### Strategy

High-level description of how we solve the problem.

### Why This Approach

What alternatives exist and why this approach fits the constraints best.

### Tools & Primitives

What cryptographic tools we're using and why:

- **[Tool 1]**: Why it's a good fit
- **[Tool 2]**: Why it's a good fit

## Protocol Design

### Participants & Roles

Who's involved and what they can do.

### Flows

#### [Flow 1]

Step-by-step.

#### [Flow 2]

Step-by-step.

### Data Structures

### On-Chain State

What lives on-chain and why.

## Cryptographic Details

### Primitives

Specific algorithms, curves, hash functions.

### Circuit Constraints (if applicable)

What the ZK circuit proves (if applicable).

## Security Model

### Threat Model

What adversaries we consider.

### Guarantees

What security properties hold.

### Limitations & Shortcuts (PoC Scope)

What's not addressed and why:

- **[Gap 1]**: Production mitigation
