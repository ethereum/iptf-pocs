## 2. Functional Requirements (MUST)

What the system must do. Organize by workflow/lifecycle phase.

- **[Requirement 1]**: e.g., Double-spend protection via nullifiers
- **[Requirement 2]**: e.g., Replay protection
- **[Requirement 3]**: e.g., Access control separation

## 5. Operational Requirements (MUST)

Non-functional requirements for real-world use.

- **Finality**: [e.g., minutes, daily cycles]
- **Cost**: [e.g., viable for daily operations]
- **Key Management**: [e.g., rotation, recovery]
- **Integration**: [e.g., compatibility with existing systems]

## 6. Out of Scope (PoC)

What this PoC explicitly does NOT address. Important for setting expectations.
