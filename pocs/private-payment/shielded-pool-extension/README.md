# Shielded Pool Extension: PIR + Epoch Nullifiers

Extension of the [shielded-pool](../shielded-pool/) private-payments construction with:

- PIR over the wallet's pre-spend tree reads, closing the state-read privacy leak at the indexer/RPC layer.
- Epoch-based nullifiers with a per-note recursive chain proof (IVC), bounding the on-chain nullifier set without imposing linear per-spend work as notes age.

The note format, deposit, and attestation flows of the parent are preserved. The commitment is extended to bind `epoch_created` so the on-chain verifier can enforce that a spend's chain proof covers the note's full lifetime.

## Status

Implemented end-to-end as a research PoC: the extended circuits, the two-proof spend contract, the off-chain stack (state replica, bb prover, SimplePIR commitment-path read, light-client storage-proof verifier), and a self-contained on-chain integration test. See "Implementation shortcuts" below for the deliberate spec-vs-impl divergences. The protocol is proof-system agnostic; see [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) for the abstract requirements an implementation must meet. This folder is a self-contained PoC (no cross-PoC imports from `../shielded-pool/`); any source mirrored from the parent is duplicated locally per the repo's PoC-independence rule.

## Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/introduction/installation)
- [Nargo](https://noir-lang.org/docs/getting_started/noir_installation) **1.0.0-beta.21** — the chain-update recursion (`bb_proof_verification`) requires it; install with `noirup -v 1.0.0-beta.21`
- [Barretenberg (`bb`)](https://barretenberg.aztec.network/docs/getting_started) **5.0.0-nightly.20260324** — run `bbup` after Nargo (it auto-resolves the matching version)
- Rust toolchain (pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`)

## Installation

```bash
cd pocs/private-payment/shielded-pool-extension

## Implementation shortcuts

[SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) describes the full protocol, including the parent's KYC attestation registry and flows (unchanged by this extension). Where this PoC's implementation deliberately diverges from the spec, it is noted here:

- **KYC attestation is not enforced in the deposit circuit.** The deposit proves only commitment well-formedness and the `epoch_created` binding; it does not verify attestation membership. This is an implementation-scope choice — attestation is orthogonal to the PIR + epoch-nullifier mechanisms this extension demonstrates, and is fully exercised in the parent [shielded-pool](../shielded-pool/) PoC.

- **Withdraw's `N_INSERTS = 1` insertion circuit/verifier is not built.** `scripts/generate-verifiers.sh` emits the real Solidity verifiers for `deposit`/`transfer`/`withdraw`/`insertion` (the latter at k=2, a 2-in transfer). The insertion circuit's leaf count is a per-circuit compile-time constant, so the single-input `withdraw` needs a 1-insertion variant of `circuits/insertion`, which isn't built. Consequently the contract's `withdrawInsertionVerifier` slot and the deploy reuse the k=2 `insertion` verifier as a placeholder, and the on-chain e2e is **transfer-scoped** — `withdraw` is exercised only in the contract unit tests (mock verifier). The two-proof contract path itself (`transfer` + `withdraw`, cross-proof η binding, `expectedChainAccumulator`, the shared `_verifyInsertionAndAdvance`) is complete.

- **No on-chain nullifier-uniqueness check (differs from the parent contract).** The parent rejected identical/spent nullifiers with an explicit mapping and `IdenticalNullifiers` guard. This extension keeps no on-chain nullifier set: active-epoch double-spend and in-tx duplicate η are caught inside the insertion proof's sorted-low-leaf step (SPEC "On-Chain State"), so the contract only pins the two proofs to one shared η list.

- **SimplePIR stands in for the SPEC's InsPIRe.** The SPEC specifies InsPIRe (single-server PIR with *silent* preprocessing). Its only Rust implementation (Google's `private-membership`) is an Ubuntu/AVX-512 benchmark CLI over synthetic databases, not a portable library, so the commitment-path read uses the published `simplepir` crate. SimplePIR gives the same index privacy (the server never learns the queried leaf) but is **not** silent — the client keeps a per-database hint from the offline `setup`. InsPIRe's hint-free profile is the documented production target.

- **The light-client check ships the verifier, not the light client.** `adapters/light_client.rs` verifies a contract storage slot against a state root via the SPEC's two-level MPT proof (`verify_account_storage`), behind the `RootVerifier` port. In production a Helios light client supplies the **consensus-verified** `state_root` (a `HeliosRootVerifier`); that isn't wired here because Helios needs a beacon chain the in-process `anvil` e2e lacks, so the test trusts an anvil block's `stateRoot`. Other root reads remain over plain RPC pending that wiring.
