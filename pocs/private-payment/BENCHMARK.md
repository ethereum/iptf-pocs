# Private Payments Benchmarks

Comparison of two implementation approaches.

> Note: these are not precise benchmarks and should not be seen as a point of reference. These are estimates gathered from documentation and code available, that we could have run. It is recommended that an implementer run their own benchmarks with the surrounding domain specific business logic & configuration surrounding it to obtain accurate measurements.


All benchmarks have been run on an m4 mbp, 14c, 48gig

### Plasma

Since the intmax2 contracts are not vendored in, these costs come from the integration test, Generated with (100 runs):

```
cd plasma && cargo test --release -- --nocapture
```

**User costs**

| Contract | Function | Min | Mean | Median | Max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Liquidity | depositERC20 | 135,412 | 137,547 | 137,547 | 139,682 |

There are also additional configurable deposit and withdrawal fees configurable by the intmax operator.

**Operator / infrastructure costs**

| Contract | Function | Min | Mean | Median | Max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rollup | postNonRegistrationBlock | 253,198 | 255,776 | 255,891 | 258,119 |
| Rollup | postRegistrationBlock | 240,105 | 242,298 | 242,298 | 244,491 |
| Rollup | processDeposits (via messenger) | 184,320 | 185,995 | 185,995 | 187,670 |
| BlockBuilderRegistry | emitHeartbeat | 29,229 | 29,229 | 29,229 | 29,229 |

> **Note on transfers:** L2 transfers between users are off-chain from a gas perspective. The block builder batches transfers into `postNonRegistrationBlock` / `postRegistrationBlock` calls, amortizing the cost across all senders in the block. In production with full blocks, the amortized cost per transfer drops.

## Computation Latency

### Shielded Pool

| Operation | Min | Mean | Median | Max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ProofGen(Deposit) | 410ms | 436ms | 428ms | 563ms |
| ProofGen(Transfer) | 891ms | 918ms | 911ms | 991ms |
| ProofGen(Withdraw) | 545ms | 564ms | 561ms | 600ms |

### Plasma

```
cd plasma && cargo test --release -- --nocapture
```

**User**

| Operation | Min | Mean | Median | Max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ProofGen(Transfer) | 5.94s | 6.78s | 6.65s | 7.82s |
| ProofGen(Withdrawal) | 7.91s | 8.76s | 8.63s | 9.81s |

**Operator / infrastructure**

| Operation | Min | Mean | Median | Max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ProofGen(Deposit) | 43.12s | 45.77s | 45.21s | 49.03s |
| ProofGen(BalanceSync/Transfer) | 42.38s | 45.14s | 44.89s | 48.21s |
| ProofGen(WithdrawalSync) | 38.45s | 41.00s | 40.72s | 43.88s |

> **Note:** Plasma proofs are generated server-side by the `balance_prover` service (plonky2-based), not locally. These timings include HTTP round-trip overhead (but they do not dominate overall timings). The balance sync operations (`sync()`, `sync_withdrawals()`) are notably slower as they involve multiple sequential proof generations (e.g., sender balance proof + receiver balance proof for transfers).
